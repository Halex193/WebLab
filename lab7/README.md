### Requirement

In this lab you will have to develop a server-side web application in PHP. The web application has to manipulate a Mysql database with 1 to 3 tables and should implement the following base operations on these tables: select, insert, delete, update. Also the web application must use AJAX for getting data asynchronously from the web server and the web application should contain at least 5 web pages (client-side html or server-side php).

For the database, you can use the mysql database on www.scs.ubbcluj.ro. On this myql server you have an account, a password and a database, all identical to your username and password on the SCS network.

Write a web application for managing food recipes. The application should maintain various information about a recipe in the database (i.e. author, name, type, the actual recipe etc.). The application should implement: recipes browsing (use AJAX for retrieving recipes of a specific type), adding, removing and updating a recipe. Also, on the browsing page, the filter used for the previous browsing action (i.e. recipe type), should be displayed (do this in javascript).
