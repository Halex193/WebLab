### Requirement

Solve the following task using only the jQuery library (production version, `jquery.min.js`, or developement version, `jquery.js`); YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO USE ANY OTHER JS LIBRARY, PLUGIN OR EXTENSION BESIDES THE JQUERY LIBRARY. Write a web page which contains a form with at least 5 input fields and a button. If the user clicks on that button a modal interface window (actually a `div`) should pop out in the center of the browser window. This modal window should contain 4 input fields and a button. If the user clicks on that button, the modal window disappears and all the values inserted by the user in the modal window's input fields will be concatenated and added to a text field in the main form. During the time the modal window is displayed, the fields from the main form will be inactive and a transparrent gray div should be displayed on top of the web page (this grey div should be beneath the modal window and should occupy the whole browser window).
