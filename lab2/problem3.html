                <div class="data"><h3>KOVEN</h3>
                    One of the most unique and exciting bass music outfits to emerge in recent times,
                    Koven is the production alias of producer Max Rowat and Katie Boyle.

                    First conceived in December 2011, the Koven project was sparked into life with the ‘Wake You Up EP’.
                    Instantly making an impact across the scene, Koven’s very first release saw support from some of the
                    most influential tastemakers of the time, including UKF and Inspector Dubplate. This free download
                    also began a trend for Koven across the airwaves, receiving substantial backing and airtime from the
                    likes of Radio 1 to XFM, as well as Ministry of Sound.

                <div class="data"><h3>MEMTRIX</h3>
                    20-year-old Oscar Rawlinson, better known as Memtrix is the next acclaimed artist signing to
                    legendary Spor/Feed Me’s flagship imprint, Sotto Voce. In 2013, he was nominated to be the
                    breakthrough producer at DNBA Awards, and in 2015 was UKF’s hotly tipped producer to watch. Coming
                    from a musical and artistic family from Kent, UK, writing music was instinctual to him, thus
                    becoming his only natural path. After playing guitar in a number of bands since the age of twelve,
                    he has taken influence from the likes of Jeff Beck, Radiohead and Lamb of God.
